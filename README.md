# meg-eegnet-predictions-and-analysis


## Overview

This project aims to identify two types of images—animate and inanimate objects—from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings using an EEGNet model. The codebase is divided into two main files:

- **`meg_eegnet_pred_analysis.py`**: This file contains all the necessary functions for data loading, feature extraction, visualization, clustering, and modeling. It serves as the backbone for the analysis of MEG data.

- **`Experiment_MEG_Datasets.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook focuses on developing model architectures capable of performing all pair classification-based clustering. It utilizes renowned MEG datasets, such as Imaging brain datasets from Kaggle, as a development set for model experimentation.
